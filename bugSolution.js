The unreliable behavior of `Linking.addEventListener` can be mitigated by combining it with `Linking.getInitialURL` and implementing more robust error handling.  The improved solution checks for an initial URL on app launch and handles potential errors gracefully. This approach increases the likelihood of catching the deep link, even if the event listener is inconsistent. Here is the updated code implementing a more robust solution using both methods and additional error handling.
