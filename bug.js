This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` function might not fire consistently across different Android devices, especially those running older versions of Android or have specific manufacturer customizations.  This can lead to deep links not being handled properly, and the app failing to respond to them as expected. The code below demonstrates the inconsistent behavior. Sometimes, the event listener registers successfully, and other times, it does not, resulting in the app failing to navigate to the expected route.
